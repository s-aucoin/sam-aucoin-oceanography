title: "Multi-Source Turbulence"
summary: "How does multi-source turbulence differ from single-source turbulence?"
---

One aspect of turbulence that I am interested in is understanding how different sources of turbulence interact with each other, and what the consequences are for the processes that depend on turbulence, like mixing. A typical way to approach questions like this in turbulence is to look to statistics, and in particular the probability density function (PDF). The standard assumption is that turbulent variables are log-normally distributed, representing the spatio-temporal intermittency of turbulence, but this result is derived assuming a single source of turbulence, among other things. How does this change if multiple sources contribute to the flow field? What would changes in the statistics mean for the dynamics of multi-source turbulence? 

If this topic interests you, please check out my publication [on the intermittency of multi-source turbulence](publications/multi-source-turbulence).
