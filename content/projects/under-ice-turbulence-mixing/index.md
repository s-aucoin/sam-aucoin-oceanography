title: "Under-Ice Turbulence and Mixing"
draft: false
summary: "How do river plumes affect under-ice turbulence and mixing in a fjord estuary?"
---

Some of the research I do is centered around the turbulence and mixing in plume structures in a variety of oceanic contexts. One of these contexts looks at the turbulence and mixing generated by the boundary layer under landfast ice in a seasonally-ice-covered fjord estuary in Labrador, Canada on tidal scales. This work is a collaboration  with the Community-based sea ice monitoring in Kaipokok Bay (Nunatsiavut) project led by May Wang,  [Dr. Eric Oliver](https://ecjoliver.weebly.com/), and Postville, NL community partners Maurice Jacque and Samantha Pilgrim. The sea ice monitoring project is itself an extension of the [Sustainable Nunatsiavut Futures](https://www.ofi.ca/sustainable-nunatsiavut-futures) project.

My involvement with the project started in 2024 and continues today. Stay tuned for publications and more information on the topic.
