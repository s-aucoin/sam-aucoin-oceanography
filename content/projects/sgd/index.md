title: "Submarine Groundwater Discharge"
summary: "Investigating the dynamics of fresh submarine groundwater discharge in a coastal setting."

Submarine Groundwater Discharge (SGD) is the phenomenon of the seepage of subterranean water into the ocean. In certain circumstances, the seepage can be concentrated and discharged as a relatively-point-source spring. Because the water is fresh, it is buoyant, however since springs discharge with a non-negligible velocity, the resulting dynamics are not simply analogous to convection.

My research in this area relates to the dynamics of SGD springs and how knowledge of more general plume structures helps address the multidisciplinary field of SGD from the ocean side.

I've presented on this topic at a few conferences. You can see some of the posters I have showed [here]({{< ref "presentations/grc2024.md" >}}) and [here]({{< ref "presentations/jsps2023.md" >}}). Stay tuned for publications on SGD.
