Current Tides is a biennial popular science magazine that is completely written and published by a team of volunteer graduate students in the department of Oceanography at Dalhousie University. The goal is to make current research done by oceanography graduate students accessible to a wide audience including non-scientists. You can read the latest and previous issues (for free!) on the [Current Tides Website](https://currenttides.ocean.dal.ca/).

My involvement with Current Tides started in 2022 when I volunteered to be an editor for Volume 6 (to be released soon, link here). I loved the idea so much that I am now the Editor-in-Chief for Volume 7! Look out for the next issue to be published in 2028.
