We as a species have a difficult time fully conceptualising things that exist on scales much larger than ourselves, but in my opinion, there is no faster way to be humbled by the vastness of the ocean than with kayaking. A good kayak is like an extension of your body; you become more connected to the water under your boat and very aware of subtle shifts in conditions. In this way, it gives you first-hand experience with the capcity of nature for cold indifference to you and your plans.

Of course, the ocean isn't always a terrifying place. Another side of kayaking is that you get to experience things from a different perspective. Travelling by your own power means there is no other option than to slow down and obseve your surroundings. Kayaking is similar to hiking in this way. Sea kayaking is the perfect opportunity for me to take thinking about the ocean to the ocean!
