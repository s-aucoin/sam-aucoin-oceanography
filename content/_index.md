I love the ocean. I find it fascinating that something seemingly so simple reveals layers and layers of complexity the closer you look. Curiosity about how these complexities function and interact with each other is what drives the motivation behind my research.

I am currently a PhD candidate at Dalhousie University in physical oceanography. My research focuses on topics related to ocean turbulence and mixing as well as plume structures. I am particularly interested in the mechanisms by which small-scale 3D turbulence influences the broader ocean. You can read more about my scientific interests and the projects I work on [here](/projects/).
